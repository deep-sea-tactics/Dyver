# Dyver
Dyver is a consolidation of core Deep Sea Tactics robot features into one application. This includes drivers, interfaces, simulations, and various other tools.

## Usage
Binaries are re-configured using the Deep Sea Shell (dss) scripting language. The program is written in C++, and assumes users are building with CMake and Clang.

## Installation Instructions
Ensure you have up-to-date CMake and Clang distributions installed on the local machine. **Note: this program functions best with the Linux (specifically Debian) operating system.** `deps.sh` contains nececssary dependencies to have installed on your machine before building, and `build_essentials.sh` contains highly-recommended/required dependencies as well. **An internet connection is required for a first build of Dyver.**
