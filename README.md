# Dyver
Dyver is an application designed to aid in the operation of an ROV. It contains drivers and mathematics to drive an ROV.

## For Developers
Useful information for developers working internally on Dyver.

* Units of Measurement
All units follow the SI standard. Units that do not follow this standard shall be converted into the standard before being placed into any data structures.

## Usage
Binaries are re-configured using the Deep Sea Shell (dss) scripting language. The program is written in C++, and assumes users are building with CMake and Clang.

## Installation Instructions

1. Build on Debian Linux! This means installing WSL (for Windows developers, if you haven't already), or using a Debian Linux machine.
Debian is the target operating system for all parts of Dyver, and it is important to do work on Debian to maintain consistency. Windows
support is not a planned feature.

2. Ensure you have an up-to-date installation of `clang` and `cmake`. In addition to these, you will want to install `gnuplot` and `libpng-dev`

3. Build with an internet connection. The two main targets are `Dyver` *(for the on-deck server and graphical user interface)* and `DyverTest` *(which contains every unit test)*.
